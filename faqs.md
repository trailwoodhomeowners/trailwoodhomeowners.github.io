# Frequently Asked Questions


## Are fences Allowed?

unless a home has an CC&R-approved pool.


## Are sheds allowed?

The Trailwood Association (Trailwood 2 and 3) CC&R’s **do not allow sheds**.


## Are pools allowed?

The Trailwood Association (Trailwood 2 and 3) CC&R’s allow **in-ground pools
only**. Above ground and hybrid pools are not permitted.


## If I ask nicely, will you permit a fence, shed, or above-ground pool?

The Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (CC&R’s) do not contain language
allowing the HOA Board of Directors to allow deviations to these requirements.
Covenants are between every property owner, and not just the HOA Board. As such,
it requires a supermajority of property owners to change the CC&R’s to allow
prohibited features.


## Are there HOA dues?

The Trailwood Association (Trailwood 2 and 3) does collect annual dues and are
collected no later than December 31st. There is a substantial late fee beyond this date.
